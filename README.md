#Protein assembler
Proteins are not isolated on the cell. They interact with each other.
Some of this interactions are obligated, and result in two or more peptide chains forming an oligomer or **protein complex**.

The objective of protein assembler is to use individual, obligated interactions between different subunits to assemble the whole protein complex. 

##Installation

First download a zipped clone from git repository, either by browser or command line:

```
$ wget https://github.com/comradeameba/SBI/archive/master.zip
```

Uncompress the zip clone:

```
unzip master.zip
```

Once uncompressed, from you current directory:

1. **Comand line version**: Just add SBI-master/bin directory to your path. Alternatively, you can copy the binary file inside bin to your path folder.
2. **Graphical version**: No need to install. To start the graphical interface, just make double-click on bin/protein_assemblerGUI binary.
